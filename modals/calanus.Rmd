![Parallel time series of neuston net-sampled lobster postlarvae and plankton net-sampled *Calanus finmarchicus* from Seabrook Station Environmental Monitoring (SSEM). The two indices were significantly correlated over the 27 yr time series (r = 0.55, P = 0.0038). Refer to Table 2 for associated correlation statistics evaluating the spatial coherence between C. finmarchicus at SSEM and young-of-the-year at American Lobster Settlement Index study areas throughout the Gulf of Maine](calanustimeseries.PNG)
