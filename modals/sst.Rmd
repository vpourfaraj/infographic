![Ocean temperature time series in the Scotian Shelf and one for the Bay of Fundy collected by DFO monitoring programs. Long-term increases are observed from in situ sea surface temperature (0 m, 1947--2016, positive trend of 0.15ºC per decade, significant at 1% level) and for the deeper layer (250 m, 1947--2016, positive trend of 0.36ºC per decade, significant at 1% level) of the Emerald Basin region of the Scotian Shelf. Depth-averaged ocean temperature (0--90 m) from the Prince 5 station in the Bay of Fundy (1924--2016, positive trend of 0.16ºC per decade, significant at 1% level) indicates a similar long-term warming trend.
